upgrade:
  - |
    A new ``osc_lib.test`` package has been added. This contains much of the
    logic previously provided by ``osc_lib.tests.utils``, but is explicitly
    designed for external consumption. Consumers of ``osc_lib.tests.utils``
    are encourgaged to migrate over at the earliest opportunity. In most
    cases, migration will simply involve changing the module path.
deprecations:
  - |
    The ``osc_lib.tests.utils`` module is now deprecated for removal and
    has been replaced by ``osc_lib.test``.
