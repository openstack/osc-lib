upgrade:
  - |
    Support for providing callables in the ``formatters`` argument to the
    ``osc_lib.utils.get_dict_properties`` and
    ``osc_lib.utils.get_item_properties`` helpers, first deprecated in 1.8.0
    (December 2017) has now been removed. You must provide subclasses of
    ``cliff.columns.FormattableColumn`` instead.
