# E203 Black will put spaces after colons in list comprehensions
# E501 Black takes care of line length for us
# H238 New Style Classes are the default in Python3
# H301 Black will put commas after imports that can't fit on one line
# H4 Are about docstrings and there's just a huge pile of pre-existing issues.
# W503 Is supposed to be off by default but in the latest pycodestyle isn't.
#      Also, both openstacksdk and Donald Knuth disagree with the rule. Line
#      breaks should occur before the binary operator for readability.
